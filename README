# Nonopticon

A few years ago I wrote a little script called "panopticon" that was designed to bundle all my recent bookmarks, flagged emails, Evernote notes and such into todos for the Mac productivity app Things. I wanted a way to empty my digital pockets out into a common spot for quick review within a few days of creating each item.

Somewhere along the way, I took a small vacation from social networking, but once I started using social networking tools again I found myself wondering why I used them, what I wanted to do with them and whether I was happy with all the sharing or if that was just a side effect of what I really wanted to do, which was just sort of keep up with myself.

So I've started working on this, which is meant to be a generic replacement for a few common bits of social networking and bookmarking I do:

* bookmarking
* location 
* journaling

It's also meant to do what the original Panopticon did for me, which is log things I've put here and there in mail, Evernote, etc. so I've got everything in one place in a sort of river of personal news.

## Goals

* create a reliable, personal bookmarking, journaling and location tracking application with tolerable mobile interface with no intent to share between users
* gather information from third-party services I still don't mind using (e.g. Evernote, Google Reader) with a mix of local scripting and third-party tools (such as ifttt).
